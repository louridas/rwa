In the covid-19 era, *social distancing* has emerged as an important
factor in the fight against the disease. We change
our habits and the way we interact with others, so that we minimize
the chances that the virus can be transmitted.

Social distancing includes rules about how close we can be to one
another. When we are brought together, we must maintain a certain
distance between ourselves. 

Then a problem emerges: if we have a given space, how many people can
fit into the space, while respecting social distancing rules? And
where should they be placed?

We can represent each person as a circle whose radius is equal to the
minimum distance we must maintain. Then the problem is to insert the
circles with the given radius inside a shape that describes the space
we want to fill.

To find where the circles should be placed, we can work as follows:

1. We put a circle at the point where we want to start the placement
   process.
   
2. We put a circle tangent to the first one, noting that each circle
   follows the other.
   
3. We interpolate a circle tangent to the last circle and the first
   circle we inserted, noting that it comes between them. We repeat
   this step to add more circles.

This is how the process will evolve for the first seven circles:

We can observe that the centers of the circles form a closed polygon.
If we want to continue the process, we must remove from the polygon
vertex $C_1$ and connect directly vertices $C_2$ and $C_7$. Then we
can interpolate a circle tangent to $C_2$ and $C_7$, as in the first
panel of the next figure.

This suggests an idea. Let us call the circles on the perimeter, next
to whom we can attach tangential circles, the *front*. To add circles,
we follow these steps: 

1. We add the first two circles (these two form a trivial front).

2. We find the circle in the front that is closest to our starting
   point. Suppose that this circle $C_m$. If there are more than one
   circles with the same distance, we pick the one that was inserted
   earliest.
   
3. We try to interpolate a circle between $C_m$ and its successor in
   the front, $C_n$. Let us call this circle $C_i$.
   
4. If $C_i$ does not intersect with any of the front's cirles, we
   insert it into our shape and we return to step 2.
   
5. Otherwise, we remove from the front the problematic circles and we
   then return to step 2.

<img src="{attach}circles_2.png" width="700">

If we continue in this way we can insert circles $C_9$ and $C_{10}$
without a problem. Then, the circle in the front that was inserter
earliest and is closest to our starting point is $C_2$, whose
successor is $C_{10}$. If we try to interpolate a circle between $C_2$
and $C_{10}$, we will find out that it falls on $C_3$. According to
step 5, we remove $C_2$ from the front, so now we have $C_3$ followed
by $C_{10}$ in the front. Returning to step 2 we find that $C_3$ is
the front circle closest to the starting point, so we add circle
$C_{11}$.

That is not a complete algorithm, because step 5 is not clear. We have
termed some circles "problematic", but we have not really defined
which they are that they should be removed from the front.

If we return to our example, we saw that, as the circle we try to
insert between $C_2$ and $C_{10}$ intersects $C_3$, we removed $C_2$
from the front. In general, if the circle $C_i$ that we are trying to
insert tangential to $C_m$ and $C_n$ intersects a circle $C_j$ that
comes before $C_m$ in the front, we remove from the front the circles
from the successor of $C_j$ up to and including $C_m$ and $C_j$
becomes the new $C_m$, as you can see in the following figure&mdash;do
not be surprised that the circles do not all have the same radius, we
would like our algorithm to work even when the circles are not equal.

<img src="{attach}circles_intersection_1.png" width="700">

If the circles are not equal, there is another possibility, that of
$C_i$ intersecting a circle $C_j$ that comes after $C_n$ in the front.
Then we remove from the front the circles from $C_n$ up to and
including the predecessor of $C_j$ and $C_j$ becomes the new $C_n$, as
shown in the following figure.

<img src="{attach}circles_intersection_2.png" width="700">

Of course, as the centers of the circles that constitute the front are
connected in a closed polygon, a circle that follows another circle
also precedes it, if we continue going round. Moreover, the circle we
are trying to insert can intersect with two circles in the front; see
the next figure. Again, do not be surprised at the strange shape of
the front, we will see that the solution we will find will work even
in such cases, which can arise when the front grows while it fills a
bounded shape.

<img src="{attach}circles_loop.png" width="400">

To detect the offending circle $C_j$ in all situations, we start from
$C_n$ and we proceed in the front till we meet $C_m$. We take note of
the first circle that is intersected by $C_i$, $C_j$, and the last,
$C_{j}'$; if $C_i$ intersects only one circle, then $C_j = C_{j}'$. We
count how many circles are between $C_n$ and $C_j$, say $b_{nj}$, and
how many there are between $C_m$ and $C_{j}'$, say $b_{mj'}$. If
$b_{mj'} < b_{nj}$, then we take as $C_j$ the circle $C_{j'}$ that
comes before $C_m$. Otherwise, we take the circle $C_j$ that comes
after $C_n$.

If for every circle in the front we keep not only its successor but
also its predecessor, then we can find $C_j$ in another way. We start
from $C_n$ and we walk one successor circle at a time towards $C_m$.
At the same time, we start from $C_m$ and we walk one predecessor
circle at a time towards $C_n$. That means that we go one step in each
direction of the front. If we find an intersecting circle in either
direction, or if we go beyond the middle of the front, we stop. If we
stopped because we found an intersecting circle, we check whether we
found it going along the successor or the predecessor circles.

Our algorithm then evolves to this:

1. We add the first two circles (these two form a trivial front).
   
2. We find the circle in the front that is closest to our starting
   point. Suppose that this circle $C_m$. If there are more than one
   circles with the same distance, we pick the one that was inserted
   earliest.
   
3. We try to interpolate a circle between $C_m$ and its successor in
   the front, $C_n$. Let us call this circle $C_i$.
   
4. If $C_i$ does not intersect with any of the front's cirles, we
   insert it into our shape and we return to step 2.
   
5. Otherwise:
    
    * If $C_i$ intersects a circle $C_j$ that precedes $C_m$, we take
      out from the front the circles from the successor of $C_j$ up to
      and including $C_m$, we let $C_j$ be the new $C_m$, and we
      return to step 3.
      
    * If $C_i$ intersects a circle $C_j$ that follows $C_n$, we take
      out from the front the circles from $C_n$ up to and including
      the predecessor of $C_j$, we let $C_j$ be the new $C_n$, and we
      return to step 3.

Our algorithm now works and will fill out the plane, beginning from
the starting point. But it does not detect where it should stop
because it has reached the boundary of the space we want to fill. To
achieve that, we have to do some more work. We will now make a
distinction between those circles of the front to which we can attach
a tangent circle without breaching the boundaries that have been set.
We will call these circles *alive*. When a circle is inserted into the
front, it is alive. The algorithm then will further evolve to this:

1. We add the first two circles (these two form a trivial front).

2. We want to insert the $i$th circle. We find the circle in the front
   that is closest to our starting point. Suppose that this circle
   $C_m$. If there are more than one circles with the same distance,
   we pick the one that was inserted earliest.
   
3. We try to interpolate a circle between $C_m$ and its successor in
   the front, $C_n$. Let us call this circle $C_i$.
   
4. If $C_i$ intersects a circle of the front:
    
    * If $C_i$ intersects a circle $C_j$ that precedes $C_m$, we take
      out from the front and kill the circles from the successor of
      $C_j$ up to and including $C_m$, we let $C_j$ be the new $C_m$,
      and we return to step 3.
      
    * If $C_i$ intersects a circle $C_j$ that follows $C_n$, we take
      out from the front and kill the circles from $C_n$ up to and
      including the predecessor of $C_j$, we let $C_j$ be the new
      $C_n$, and we return to step 3.
      
5. At this point we have found a circle $C_i$ that does not intersect
   any circle in the front. We then check whether it breaches the
   boundaries of our shape.
    
    * If it does, then the circle $C_m$ that we picked in step 2
      cannot be used to add a circle tangent to it inside the
      boundaries of our shape, so we must go back and try to find a
      different $C_m$. We put back in the front any circles that we
      removed in step 4. We resurrect any circles that we may have
      killed in step 4, apart from those that we have found in step 2
      while trying to find the $i$th circle. We kill $C_m$ and we
      return to step 2.
      
     * If it does not, we insert $C_i$ in the front and we return to
       step 2 to insert the next circle ($i \leftarrow i + 1$),
       resurrecting all the circles in the front.

Steps 2&ndash;5 are repeated until we have inserted the desired number of
circles or we cannot add a circle because there is no circle left
alive in the front.

Let's delve a bit deeper in what is going on with circles that are
alive, dead, and resurrected. When we try to add a circle $C_i$ with a
given radius, we find the circle in the front, $C_m$, that is closest
to our starting point. The tangent circle that we try to add can
intersect with the front, so we then need to adjust the front. The
circles we remove from the front are no longer alive. After doing
that, however, we may discover that our efforts have been in vain,
because the tangent circle hits the boundaries of our shape. Then we
should not have picked that $C_m$ in the first place and we should not
have adjusted the front. Circle $C_m$ must remain dead, as well as any
previous $C_m$ circles that we may have tried in our effort to insert
$C_i$ in the shape; all other circles that we killed by adjusting the
front must be resurrected. When finally we do manage to insert $C_i$
somewhere, we will continue to add circle $C_{i+1}$; when we begin
our effort to insert a new circle, we must start fresh, by having all
the circles in the front alive.

As for the resurrection itself, in reality this is but an
implementation of an undo functionality. When we undo our actions, we
reverse them from the most recent to the previous ones, going
backwards in time; that is, we use a Last In First Out (LIFO) logic.

### Roundings

Let's take three circles with radii equal to $1$, as in the following
figure. $C_1$ is centered at $(0, 0)$, $C_2$ at $(2, 0)$, and $C_3$ at
$(1, \sqrt{3})$; $C_3$ is tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2$ and the
coordinates of its center can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
What is the distance between the centers of $C_1$ and $C_2$ and
between $C_1$ and $C_3$? Both distances are equal to $2$, as all the
radii are equal. 

<img src="{attach}three_circles.png" width="300">

Suppose now that from the coordinates of $C_1$ and $C_3$ we want to
calculate anew the distance $C_1 C_3$. Using the Pythagorean theorem
again, this distance will be equal to $\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2} = 2$.
If, however, we carry out the calculation in our computer, we will
find that the result is $1.999\ldots < 2$.

This happens because real (floating point) numbers are stored in a
computer with a specific precision; therefore, irrational numbers are
not stored exactly and calculations involving irrational numbers will
produce different results than what we would expect from theory. In
this assignment, you should use roundings to avoid surprises:

* Round the distance from the center of a circle to the starting
  point.
  
* Once we calculate the coordinates of the center of a new circle,
  round the coordinates.
  
* When you check whether two circles intersect, you must check whether
  the distance of their centres is greater than the sum of their
  radii. Round that distance before making the comparison.
  
* Round the distance of a circle from a line segment.

Round the numbers to two decimal places. If you do that, your program
would find that in the previous figure, the distance $C_1 C_3$ is
equal to the distance $C_1 C_2$. 

Having said that, rounding to two decimal places means losing
precision, so again your calculations may not be what theory would
predict. But at least you will know where any discrepancies come from.

### Finding the Circle Closest to the Starting Point

If $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of the starting point, then to find
the circle in the front that is closest to the starting point, we need
to find the distances of the centers of the front's circles to the
starting point. For every circle in the front with center at $(m_x,
m_y)$, the distance is:

$$ d = \sqrt{(m_x - x)^2 + (m_y - y)^2} $$

If $(x, y) = (0, 0)$, then we have:

$$ d = \sqrt{m_{x}^2 + m_{y}^2} $$

For simplicity we will be using $(0, 0)$ as our starting point.

### Finding a Circle Tangent to Two Other Circles

If we have two circles $C_m$ and $C_n$ and we want to find a third
circle $C_k$, wih radius $r$, tangent to these two, as in the
following figure, we work as follows:

<img src="{attach}circles_tangent.png" width="400">

* We calculate the horizontal distance $d_x$ and the vertical distance
  $d_y$ of the two circles $C_m$ and $C_n$. If $(m_x, m_y)$ is the
  center of $C_m$ and $(n_x, n_y)$ is the center of $C_n$, we have:
  $$d_x = n_x - m_x$$ 
  $$d_y = n_y - m_y $$
  
* We calculate the distance between the centers of $C_m$ and $C_n$;
  $$ d = \sqrt{d{_x}^2+ d{_y}^2}$$
  
* If $r_m$ is the radius of $C_m$ and $r_n$ is the radius of $C_n$, we
  calculate:
  $$r_1 = r_m + r $$
  $$r_2 = r_n + r $$
  
* We find:
  $$\lambda = \frac{r{_1}^2 - r{_2}^2 + d^2}{2 d^2}$$
  $$\varepsilon = \sqrt{\frac{r{_1}^2}{d^2} - \lambda^2}$$
  
* The center $(k_x, k_y)$ of circle $C_k$ is:
   $$k_x = m_x + \lambda d_x \mp \varepsilon d_y $$
   $$k_y = m_u + \lambda d_y \pm \varepsilon d_x $$
   
* We observe that we have two centers. We will use the first of them
  (that is, $- \varepsilon d_y$ for $k_x$ and $+ \varepsilon d_x$
  for $k_y$). Then the circles will be added to our shape
  counter-clockwise, as in our examples.

If we had a ruler and a compass, it would be easy to find the tangent
circles with a simple geometrical construction. In the figure you can
see that it suffices to find the intersection points $C_m$ and $C_n$
with radii $r_m + r$ and $r_n + r$ respectively. The mathematical
formulas above are derived using vector analysis.

### Distance of Circle from Line Segment

To find the distance of a circle from a line segment that lies between
two points $u$ and $v$, we must first find the distance of the center
of the circle from the segment. If the circle's center has
coordinates, $(c_x, c_y)$, we go like this:

* We calculate the square of the distance between the two points:
  $$ l_2 = (u_x - v_x)^2 + (u_y - v_y)^2$$
  
* If this distance is equal to zero, then the two endpoints of the
  segment coincide, therefore the distance from the center of the
  circle is simply:
  $$d = \sqrt{(u_x - c_x)^2 + (u_y - c_y)^2}$$
  
* Otherwise, we calculate:
  $$ t = \frac{(c_x - u_x) (v_x - u_x) + (c_y - u_y) (v_y - u_y)}{l_2}$$
  
* We make sure that $t$ is between $0$ and $1$:
  $$t = \max(0, \min(1, t))$$
  
* We find the projection $p$ of the center of the circle on the line
  segment:
  $$ p_x = u_x + t (v_x - u_x) $$
  $$ p_y = u_y + t (v_y - u_y) $$
  
* The distance of the center from the segment is:
  $$d = \sqrt{(p_x - c_x)^2 + (p_y - c_y)^2}$$

The above hold beause if we have two points $u$ and $v$, the straight
line passing through these two points is given by the parametric
equations:

$$ x = u_x + t(v_x - u_x) $$
$$ y = u_y + t(v_y - u_y) $$

The projection of a point $p$ on the line uses the initial value of
$t$. However, the projection may lie beyond the limits of the line
segment, as you can see in the following figure. The projection of the
centre of left circle falls to the left of the segment, so we take the
distance of the centre from $u$ by using $t = 0$. The projection of
the centre of the middle circle falls inside the segment so no
adjustment of $t$ is needed. In way symmetric to the left circle, the
projection of the center of the right circle lies to the right of the
segment, so we take the distance of the centre from $v$ by using $t =
1$. Then, we calculate the distance of the centre of the circle
from the projection.

<img src="{attach}distance_circle_segment.png" width="700">

Having found the distance of the circle's center from the line
segment, to find the distance of the circle from the segment we
subtract the circle's radius. Or, to find whether the circle
intersects the segment, we compare the distance from the centre with
the radius.

### Requirements

You will write a program called `social-distancing.py`. You may use
the standard Python libraries `math`, `random`, `argparse`, and `sys`,
but not any others. Your program will be called as follows:
```bash
python social_distancing.py [-items ITEMS] 
                            [-r RADIUS]
                            [--min_radius MIN_RADIUS]
                            [--max_radius MAX_RADIUS] 
                            [-b BOUNDARY_FILE] 
                            [-s SEED]
                            output_file
```

The meaning of the program arguments is:

* `-i ITEMS`, `--items ITEMS`: the number of items (circles) that we
  want to insert. If given, the program will try (but may not be able
  to) insert that many circles.
  
* `-r RADIUS`, `--radius RADIUS`: the circles radii. If given, all
  circles will have the same radius.
  
* `--min_radius MIN_RADIUS`: the minimum radius. If given, circles
  will have random radii not smaller than `MIN_RADIUS`. 
  This argument must be used with `--max_radius`.
  
* `--max_radius MAX_RADIUS:`: the maximum radius. If given, circles
  will have random sizes no bigger than `MAX_RADIUS`. This argument
  must be used with `--min_radius`.
  
* `-b BOUNDARY_FILE`, `--boundary_file BOUNDARY_FILE`: the boundaries
  of the shape we want to fill. If given, the program will try to
  place the circles inside the given shape.
  
* `-s SEED`, `--seed SEED`: if given the seed for the pseudo-random
  genereation; you should use `random.seed(SEED)` at the beginning of
  your program.
  
* `output_file`: the file where the results of the program will be
  stored; this is a mandatory argument.

When the program finishes, it will print on its output an integer
number, the number of circles it managed to insert. The circles
themselves will be saved in `output_file`, one in each line, in the
following format:
```text
x y r
```
That is, each line contains three real numbers, the $x$ coordinate of
the circle's center, the $y$ coordinate of the circle's center and its
radius $r$. The numbers must be given with two decimal places.

If boundaries are given through `-b BOUNDARY_FILE`, the value of
`BOUNDARY_FILE` will be the name of a file that specifies the borders.
The file will contain lines of the form:
```text
x1 y1 x2 y2
```
That is, each line will contain two coordinate pairs defining a line
segment. Your program will then include these lines, in the order they
are read, at the end of `output_file`, after the produced circles.

To visualize your results, you may use the following programs:

* [`svg_draw.py`](svg_draw.py)<br/>
    which you call with:<br/>
    ```bash
    python svg_draw.py input_file output_file
    ```
    <br/> 
    where `input_file` is the output file of your program and
    `output_file` will be an SVG file. You will need to install the 
    [`svgwrite`](https://github.com/mozman/svgwrite) library.
    
* [`mpl_draw.py`](mpl_draw.py)<br/>
    which you call with:<br/>
    ```bash
    python mpl_draw.py input_file output_file
     ```
    <br/> 
    where `input_file` is the output file of your program and
    `output_file` is a file whose type is determined by its suffix.
    For example, if you specify `myfile.png` as `output_file` you will
    get a PNG image; if you specify `myfile.svg` you will get an SVG
    image; if you specify `myfile.pdf` you will get a PDF image, and
    so on. You will need to install the
    [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) library.

### Examples

_Example 1_

If you invoke the program with:
```bash
python social_distancing.py -i 11 -r 10 circles_equal_11.txt

[`square_holes.txt`](square_holes.txt) to define the boundaries, it
will print `584` and it will store its results in 
[`square_holes_random.txt`](square_holes_random.txt). This file
corresponds to the following figure.

### Notes

* The proof for the formulas for finding tangent circles is in 1.12.2
  and 3.12.2 of [@vince:2005]. The proof for finding the distance of a
  point from a line segment comes from 1.11.12 και 3.11.10 of the same
  book and <https://stackoverflow.com/a/1501725>.
* The algorithm described in the assignment for filling the plane
  without boundaries was published in [@wang:2006].
* The problem is a special case of *circle packing*, which has
  attracted the attention of mathematicians for centuries. You can
  find some details at the [Wikipedia
  article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing).
* The modified algorithm for filling the circles in a defined shape is
  not designed to be optimal; however, it differs from simple circle
  packing because it is an *online algorithm*. It tries to pack as
  many circles as possible in a given space, while having to place
  each circle as it comes, and without having the opportunity to move
  a set circle to another place. It therefore solves social distancing
  when we have to place people as they come, people may have different
  space requirements around them, and we cannot move people once we
  have put them in their position.
