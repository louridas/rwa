# Points Covering

Imagine that you have a set of points on a plane and you want to cover
them with a set of straight lines. Can you find the mininum number of
straight lines passing through the points so that you cover all of
them?

This is the so-called *hitting objects problem*. The name is derived
from thinking that we have a set of objects that we want to hit them
with the minimum number of shots. Of course, the problem is more
general than just an application of ballistics or optimizing a bombing
campaign. You may need to find the minimum number of straight segments
that lie on a number of facilities on the plain, such as irrigation
channels connecting reservoirs. Be it as it may, this assignment is
titled "Points Covering", instead of "Hitting Objects", to defuse any
trigger-happy orientation.

For example, see the following figure, which shows 18 points.

We can cover these points using five lines, as follows:

Alternatively, if we have the additional requirements that the lines
should be horizontal or vertical, then the optimum solution uses six
lines:

The question is, how do we go about finding these solutions?
 
## Solution Method

Selecting the minimum number of lines passing through a set of points
is an instance of the more general *set covering problem*. This is
defined as follows: If we have a set of elements, which we call
*universe*, $U = \{1, 2, \ldots n\}$, and a set $S$ of $m$ sets whose
union equals the universe, find the smallest subset of $S$ whose union
equals the universe. The set covering problem is equivalent to the
points covering problem if we take $U$ to be the set of points that we
want to cover and $S$ the set of lines poassing through the points
(each line defined by the points it goes through).

For example, let's have as universe $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and the
set of sets $S = \{\{1\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\},
\{4, 5\}\}$. We can see that the union of all members of $S$ gives us
$U$, but we can also cover $U$ using the $\{\{1, 2, 3\}, \{4, 5\}\}$
subset of $S$.

Unfortunately, the set covering problem cannot be solved in polynomial
time. Indeed, take this approach:

* For every possible subset of $S$:

  * Check if it covers $U$.

  * If yes, and it is smaller than the best candidate solution that we
    have found so far, note it as the best candidate solution.
      
When these steps finish, the final candidate solution will also be the
best. The problem lies in the phrase "for every possible subset of
$S$". If a set contains $m$ elements, the number of possible subsets
is $2^m$; therefore, unless $m$ is small, there is no way we can find
the solution in a reasonable amount of time. 

Of course, if you think about it, you do not need to check every
possible subset of $S$. As we want the minimum number of elements, or
to be more specific, lines, we can improve our approach:

* Enumerate the subsets of $S$ in increasing size (number of lines):

  * Check if the current subset covers $U$.

  * If yes, that is the solution we are looking for and we can stop.

This will give us the best solution. If we go on without stopping, we
may find another solution with the same number of lines, which won't
improve on what we have already found, or with a larger number of
lines, which we don't want.

The problem remains that even this improved approach will not
necessarily run in a reasonable amount of time. The points that we
want to cover may be placed in way that only pairs of them are
colinear. Then, if we have $n$ points, we need $n/2$ lines to cover
them, but we don't know that beforehand. We will start checking with
the smallest number of lines and then go on increasing the number of
lines until we get to the required $n/2$ lines:

* Subsets with zero lines (the empty subset).

* Subsets containing only one line (these will cover only two points
  each).

* Subsets containing two lines (these will cover only four points
  each).

* And so and so forth, until we arrive at a subset containing $n/2$
  lines. 

So, in the end, we will still need to check an exponential number of
subsets, of the order of $2^{n/2}$. Now, you may observe that we don't
need to check subsets with zero lines or one line, but that is just a
drop in the ocean of possible solutions that we have to check. If you
want to see an example of points that are only pairwise colinear,
check the [No-three-in-line problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-three-in-line_problem).

Alternatively, we can use a different approach, which will complete
fast, but it is not guaranteed to come up with the best solution:

* Start with a new, empty solution.

* While not all elements of $U$ have been covered:

  * Find the member of $S$ that covers the greatest number of
  uncovered elements and add them to the solution.

This approach is a *greedy algorithm*, because at each step in the
iteration it proceeds by opting for the maximum immediate payoff (the
maximum number of elements that can be covered at that point). But
this does not ensure that at the end we will have the best solution
overall. As we know, delayed gratification has something going for it,
and a greedy algorithm may have to pay a price in the long run. If we
return to the example with the points and the lines that run
horizontally or vertically, a greedy algorithm could finish with the
following solution, instead of the best one:

<img src="{attach}hitting_objects_4.png" width="700"/>

How can this happen? The greedy algorithm may select the vertical line
that cuts the horizontal axis at 11, then the vertical line that cuts
the horizontal axis at 10, and so on, adding vertical lines to the
solution until it reaches 7 on the horizontal axis. Then it will have
to cover the remaining points with abscissae 1 to 6 by adding
horizontal lines to the solution.

## Requirements

You will write a program called `points_cover.py`. You may use the
following libraries:
[`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html),
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or
[`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) (in particular,
the list `sys.argv`) to handle program arguments.

Your program will be called as follows:

```bash
python points_cover.py [-f] [-g] points_file
```

The meaning of the program arguments is:

* The argument`-f` (full exploration), if given, instructs the program
  to find the best solution, examining as many subsets as needed. If
  the problem is small, that is, there are few lines, the program
  should finish relatively fast. If the problem is not small then the
  program may take, literally, ages to finish, but that is not your
  problem. If the argument `-f` is not given, the program will execute
  the greedy algorithm.
  
* The argument `-g` (grid), if given, instructs the program to find
  only lines that are horizontal or vertical. If it is not given, the
  program may use any lines that pass through the points.

* The argument `points_file` is the name of the file that contains the
  points we want to cover. The file consists of lines of the form:
  
  ```text
  x y
  ```
  where `x` is the $x$-axis coordinate and `y` is the $y$-axis
  coordinate of each point.

If we specify `-g` and it is not possible to cover all points with
lines passing through at least two of them, you may use horizontal
lines that pass through the points that are not colinear with another
point in the horizontal or vertical direction. So, if there is a point
$(x, y)$ and there is no point $(x', y)$ or $(x, y')$, you can use the
line $((x, y), (x + 1, y))$.

The lines that will comprise your solutions must appear in descending
order based on the number of points they cover. In other words, lines
covering more points will precede lines covering fewer points. For
each line, the point it covers will appear in ascending order, based
on their coordinates. Lines covering the same number of points will
appear in ascending order, depending on the coordinates of their
points. 

Depending on your implementation, you may need to sort the input
points you read from `points_file`.

### Examples

_Example 1_

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python points_cover.py example_1.txt
```

then the program will read the file 
[`example_1.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/points-covering/example_1.txt)
and will display the following result:

```text
(1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 3) (4, 4) (5, 5) (6, 6)
(7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 5)
(7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6)
(10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3)
(11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6)
```

This is the first solution we saw for covering the 18 points given in
the beginning of this assignment.

_Example 2_

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python points_cover.py -f -g example_1.txt
```

then the program will read the file 
[`example_2.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/points-covering/example_2.txt)
and will display the following result:

```text
(1, 1) (7, 1) (10, 1)
(2, 2) (7, 2) (10, 2)
(3, 3) (8, 3) (10, 3)
(4, 4) (8, 4) (11, 4)
(5, 5) (9, 5) (11, 5)
(6, 6) (9, 6) (11, 6)
```

This is the second solution we saw for covering the 18 points given in
the beginning of this assignment.

_Example 3_

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python points_cover.py -g example_2.txt
```

then the program will read the file 
[`example_2.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/points-covering/example_2.txt)
and will display the following result:

```text
(10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3)
(11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 6)
(12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 9)
(1, 1) (10, 1)
(2, 2) (10, 2)
(3, 3) (10, 3)
(4, 4) (11, 4)
(5, 5) (11, 5)
(6, 6) (11, 6)
(7, 7) (12, 7)
(8, 8) (12, 8)
(9, 9) (12, 9)
```
