    <h1>Assignments</h1>
    

    <p>The assignments that follow are small programming projects that go
beyond the exercises given at the end of the chapters. To complete
them you have to implement an algorithm, as described, which is not
one of the algorithms given in the book. The purpose is to exercise
algorithmic thinking: are you able to solve a problem, even though the
algorithm is described in less detail than in the book?</p>
<p>At the time the assignments were written, there were no ready-made
solutions available online. This may no longer be true. That is the
situation in most programming exercises today: a competent solution
may be just a web search away. If you are tempted to do so, take a
step back and ask yourself why. You may be able to find a solution to
a problem, but this will not help you master the art. If you do want
to master the art, you will have to sweat for it. If you do not, you
may be happier doing something else altogether.</p>
<h5>Difficulty</h5>
<p>To indicate the relative difficulty of the assignments, a scale using
chess pieces has been adopted: the difficulty ranges from the pawn
(&#9817;) to the bishop (&#9815;), then the rook (&#9814;) and finally
the queen (&#9813;). That does not mean that all, say, pawn
assignments are of exactly the same difficulty; but it does mean that
they are all qualitatively different from those of the bishop
difficulty (and even more, from rooks and queens). As a general
guideline, the scale should not be understood as following the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value">chess piece relative value system</a>,
where a bishop assignment would be <em>on average</em> three times as difficult
as a pawn, a rook five times, and a queen nine times.</p>
